w: My heart and tongue were twinnes, at * once con- * ceiv- ed, Th'el- dest was my heart, my heart, borne dumbe by de- sti- nie, The last my tongue, of all sweet thoughts, sweet thoughts be- rea- * ved: Yet strung and tunde to * * play, to play hearts har- mo- nie. *|
w: Both knit in one, and yet a * sun- der * plac- ed, what heart would speake the tongue, the tongue, doth full dis- co- ver What tongue doth speake is of the heart, the heart em- bra- * ced, and both are one to * * make, to make a new found Lov- er.|
w: New found, and one- ly found in * Gods and * Kings, * whose wordes are deedes, but wordes, but wordes, nor deedes re- gar- ded. Chaste thoughts doe mount and flye with swift- est, swift- * est * wings, My love with paine, my * * paine, my paine with losse re- ward- ed.|

w: Then this be sure, this be sure, Since it is true, it is true per- fec- tion, That ney- ther men, that ney- ther men, ney- ther men nor * Gods, nor Gods can force af- fec- tion.|
