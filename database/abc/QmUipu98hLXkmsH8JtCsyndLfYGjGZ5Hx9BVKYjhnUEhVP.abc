"^___________________________________________\nEdited by B. C. Johnston, 2016\n   1. All notes half value of original.\n   2. Measure 4, \nAlto\n: sharp on last note (F) ignored.\n   3. Converted to two staffs: Original \nTenor\n becomes \nSoprano\n, up one octave; \nMedius\n becomes \nAlto\n; \nCantus\n becomes \nTenor\n, down\n        one octave; and Bass remains.""^2. Such  as the Lord redeem–ed   hath                                               And show how they from foes were freed,\n                                                                      With thanks shall praise his name:                                                      And how he wrought the same.""^3. Let men therefore before the Lord  Confess his goodness then:  And show the wonders  that he doth   Before   the   sons   of   men.\n4. And  let  them offer  sac – ri –  fice   To  him  most  thankfully:  And speak of all his wondrous works  With gladness and with joy.""^5. Let them in presence of the folk  With praise extol his name: And where  the  elders  do convene,   There  let  them do the same.\n6. But yet  the  poor  he  raiseth  up   Out of his troubles deep:     And often does his train augment,      Much like  a  flock  of sheep.""^7. The righteous shall behold this light, And  also much rejoice: Whereas  the  wicked and perverse  With grief shall stop their voice.\n8.  But who is wise  that know full  well  He may these things record; For  certainly  such  shall   perceive  The kindness of the  Lord." A,4 A,2 A,2 A,6 A,2 G,2 G,2 F,4 | %1
