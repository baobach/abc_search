"^________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe words were probably written by Jeremiah Ingalls, for use at the funeral of Polly Gould, who died as a child in 1790, the music and words\npublished in 1805. The stanzas used here selected from among the sixteen originally written.\n \nThis tune was revised by Lucius Chapin in 1813, rewriting it in E minor,   putting it to words by Isaac Watts (\nLord, what a heaven \nof saving grace\n) and renaming it \nVernon\n. Chapin's revision was put to differemt words by Charles Wesley (\nCome, O thou traveller \nunknown\n) in Samuel Metcalf's \nThe Kentucky Harmonist\n, 1818. This was repeated by William Walker, reduced to three parts, in \nSouthern Harmony\n (p. 34) in 1830.  Moore's version was restored in \nThe Sacred Harp\n (p. 55b) from 1844 through 1911; the 1991 \nedition has it on page 95b." D,6 A,,2 | %13
