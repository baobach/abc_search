"^________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n   A folk hymn, first published by Pilsbury in1799, deriving from earlier oral or manuscript sources (Jackson 1953b, No. 80; David Music 1995).\n   The complex history of this tune is described in David Music (1995).\n   This tune was arranged to three parts by Allen Carden and others in \nWestern Harmony \n(1824), as \nCharlestown\n, with different words (John Newton, \"Mercy, O thou\nson of David\"). Carden's version then was reprinted in William Walker's \nSouthern Harmony\n (1835), p. 23, and reprinted in \nThe Sacred Harp\n (1844), p. 52.\n   This tune was also arranged to two parts (Tenor-Bass) in Joshua Leavitt's \nChristian Lyre\n (1830), as \nBartimeus\n, with the same words as Carden. Leavitt's version was \nthen expanded to four parts by William Hauser in \nThe Hesperian Harp\n (1848); except for the Tenor part, Hauser's arrangement is different from Pilsbury's.\n   This tune was also arranged to three parts by Joseph Funk in \nCompilation of Genuine Church Music\n (1835), as \nCharleston\n, but with different words (John Wingrove,\n\"Hail, my ever-blessed Jesus\")."
