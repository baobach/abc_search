"^1. Come, we that love the Lord,  And  let  our  joys  be known;   Join in  a song with  sweet accord,    And  thus          surround   the   throne.\n2. The sorrows of  the mind   Be  ba – nished  from  the  place;     Re–li–gion  ne–ver  was  designed     To    make          our  plea – sures   less.\n3. Let those refuse  to  sing    That  never   knew   our       God;      But favorites of the heav'nly King    May  speak        their   joys  a  –  broad." c2 AB | %1

This   aweful  God  is   ours,  Our  Father  and  our  Love;    He shall send down his heav'nly powers   To     car     –     ry       us     a   –  bove.\n6.
