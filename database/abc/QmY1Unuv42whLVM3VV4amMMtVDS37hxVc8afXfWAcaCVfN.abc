"_1. O Jesus, my Savior, on Thee I'll depend, When troubles are near me you'll be my true Friend.\n\n2. When ladened with troubles and burdened with grief, To Jesus in secret I'll go for relief.\n\n3. In dark days of bondage to Jesus I prayed, To help me to bear it, an' He gave me His aid.\n\nCHO. - I'm troubled, I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind; If Jesus don't help me, I surely will die." z2 | %6
