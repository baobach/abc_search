"^Several nations have used this splendid dignified tune, either as a national anthem, or as a composition of the utmost importance. Parts of the melody have been traced back as far as Dr. John Bull (1563-1628), but the composer of the melody in its final form is still unknown, though many continue to credit it to Henry Carey, an Englishman (1690-1743). The words were written in 1832 by Reverend S. F. Smith, an American clergymen. The song was first sung publicly at a children's celebration of American independence in the Park Street Church, Boston, July 4, of that year. Numerous other verses have been written to this melody. Two of the best are the ones below by Henry Van Dyke."!mf!"^Andante con moto" [DG]2 [EG]2 [EA]2 | %1
