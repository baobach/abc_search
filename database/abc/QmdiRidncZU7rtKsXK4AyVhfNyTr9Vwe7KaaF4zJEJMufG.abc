"^Notes:The original order of staves is not specified in the source, but appears to be Tenor - Alto - Soprano (air) - Bass, and hasbeen treated as such here: the tenor and alto parts are given in the source in the treble clef, an octave above soundingpitch, and the air and bass are bracketed together, with the bass figured for keyboard accompaniment.Only the first verse of the text is given in the source: the subsequent verses have been added here, as indicated bythe heading ‘Psalm 14th. Ver: 2. 3. 5. 6. 7.’ in the source.The three notes in the soprano part on beat 3 of bar 12 given here as a dotted crotchet followed by two semiquavers, areprinted in the source as a full-sized minim followed by two small quaver grace notes.The tenor semibreve on beats 1-2 of bar 14, given here as a C, is printed in the source as the Eb a minor third higher.""^6" (D,3 F, B,4)"^7" (A,2"^Y" G,2) | %12
