"____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPilsbury 1799 was the first printing of this tune. It was considerably revised  by James P. Carrell in 1821,who retitled it \nPilgrim\n, moved it to A minor, and added new words, \nCharles Wesley's \nHow happy every child of grace\n (1759).  A three-part reduction appears as \nChild of Grace \non p. 77 in \nThe Sacred Harp\n  from 1844; a new Alto part was \nadded in 1911. A description of the history of this tune is given in David Music (1995)." A,4 B,4 | %15
