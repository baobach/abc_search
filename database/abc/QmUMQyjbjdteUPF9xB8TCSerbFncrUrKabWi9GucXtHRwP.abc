"^Notes:Thomas Clark’s The Congregational Harmonist, or Clerk’s Companion was published in 32 numbered parts (eachconsisting of 18 pages), grouped into four books (eight parts per book). The pages are consecutively paginatedthroughout the work as a whole. This setting appears on the last page of no. 25.Volume 3 of The Congregational Harmonist (consisting of numbers 17-24) was advertised on p12 of No. 1 ofThe Musical World, on 18 March 1836. No. 28 of The Congregational Harmonist was advertised on p128 ofNo. 48, Vol. 4, of The Musical World, on 10 February 1837. Bearing these dates in mind, it seems likely thatno. 25 of The Congregational Harmonist was published during 1836.This setting is attributed ‘T. Clark’ in The Congregational Harmonist, where it is marked with a crossed circle, asymbol used in that book to indicate ‘originals’ (i.e. tunes not previously published).The order of parts in the source is Alto - Tenor - Air - Bass, with the Alto and Tenor parts given in the treble clef anoctave above sounding pitch.Only the first verse of the text is given in the source: subsequent verses have here been added editorially." z2 G,"^6"B, C2 G,2 | %10
