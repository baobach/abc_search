"^2. The present moments just appear,\nThen slide away in haste,\nThat we can never say, \"They're here,\"\nBut only say, \"They're past.\"\n3. Our life is ever on the wing,\nAnd death is ever nigh;\nThe moment when our lives begin\nWe all begin to die.\n4. Yet, mighty God! our fleeting days\nThy lasting favors share,\nYet with the bounties of thy grace\nThou load'st the rolling year." ([F,,F,]2 [G,,G,]2 [A,,A,]2) [G,,G,]2 | %11
 [F,,F,]4"^5. 'Tis sovereign mercy finds us food,\nAnd we are clothed with love;\nWhile grace stands pointing out the road\nThat leads our souls above.\n6. His goodness runs an endless round;\nAll glory to the Lord!\nHis mercy never knows a bound,\nAnd be his name adored!\n7. Thus we begin the lasting song;\nAnd when we close our eyes,\nLet the next age thy praise prolong,\nTill time and nature dies.""^5.
