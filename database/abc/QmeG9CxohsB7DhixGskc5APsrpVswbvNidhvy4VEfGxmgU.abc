T:2. "Fear not," said he (for mighty dread Had seized their troubled minds); "Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind. 3. "To you in David's town this day Is born of David's line A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, And this shall be the sign: 4. "The heav'nly Babe you there shall find To human view displayed, All meanly wrapped in swathing bands, And in a manger laid." 5. Thus spake the Seraph; and forthwith Appeared a shining throng Of angels praising God, who thus Addressed their joyful song: 6. All glory be to God on high, And to the Earth be peace; Goodwill henceforth from Heav'n to men Begin and never cease."
