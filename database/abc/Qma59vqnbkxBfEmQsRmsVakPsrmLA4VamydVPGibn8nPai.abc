"^Original order of staves is Counter - Tenor - Treble - Bass, with the counter part printed in the treble clef an octave abovesounding pitch. Figuring of the vocal bass part in the source has been omitted from the present edition to aid the underlayingof the text. The first verse only of the text is given in the source: subsequent verses have been added editorially, on the basisof the title 'Psalm 135th. Verses 1. 2. 3. & 5.' in the source. The following notes are printed in the source as small grace notes,and have been editorially written out in full: bar 2, beat 3, alto F; bar 3, beat 3, soprano F; bar 10, beat 3, alto G and second A;bar 12, beat 3, soprano D and alto Bb; bar 13, beat 3, alto G and second F.A note after this tune in the source reads ‘N. B. The above Psalm may be sung as a Christmas Hymn to the words,Shepherds rejoice lift up your eyes And send your fears away. &c:’.""^Inst." F,4 z2"^["!f!"^]" z A, | %12
