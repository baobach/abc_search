"^Original order of staves is Counter - Tenor - Treble - Bass: the counter part is notated in the source in the treble clef, anoctave above sounding pitch. The vocal bass part is figured in the source: this figuring has been omitted from the presentedition to facilitate the underlaying of the text. The first verse only of the text is given in the source: subsequent verseshave been added editorially, on the basis of the title 'Psalm the 31st. 1st 2d 3d & 5th Verses' in the source.The following notes have are given in the source as small notes with a time value surplus to the total for their bar, and havebeen expanded to full-sized notes: treble part, A and G on the first half of beat 4 of bar 1, given as a small semiquaverfollowed by a full-sized quaver; counter part, E, D and E on beat 4 of bar 1, given as a full-sized crotchet followed by twosmall semiquavers; counter part, A and G on beat 4 of bar 5, given as a small quaver followed by a full-sized crotchet;tenor part, D and C on beat 1 of bar 7, given as a small quaver followed by a full-sized crotchet."
