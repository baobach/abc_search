"^2. Thou sun with golden beams,\nAnd moon with paler rays;\nYe starry lights, ye twinkling flames,\nShine to your Maker's praise.\n3. He built those worlds above,\nAnd fixed their wondrous frame;\nBy his command they stand or move,\nAnd ever speak his name.\n4. By all his works above\nHis honors be expressed;\nBut saints that taste his saving love\nShould sing his praises best." E,8- | %10

Let vigorous youth engage\nTo sound his praises high:\nWhile growing babes, and withering age,\nTheir feebler voices try.\n6. United zeal be shown\nHis wondrous fame to raise:\nGod is the Lord; his name alone\nDeserves our endless praise.\n7. Let nature join with art,\nAnd all pronounce him blest;\nBut saints, that dwell so near his heart,\nShould sing his praises best." G,2 | %12
