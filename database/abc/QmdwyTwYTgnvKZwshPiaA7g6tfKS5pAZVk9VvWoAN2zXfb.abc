w: When * the poore Cri- ple by the poole did lye, Full ma- ny yeeres in mi- se- ry and paine, and paine, No soon- er hee on Christ, on Christ had set his eye, But hee was well, hee was well, and com- fort came a- gaine, and * com- fort came a- gaine. No Da- * vid, Job, nor cri- ple in more griefe, Christ give mee, give mee pa- * tience, Christ give me pa- tience, and my hopes re- liefe.|
