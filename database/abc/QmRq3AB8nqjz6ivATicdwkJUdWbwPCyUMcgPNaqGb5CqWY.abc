"^Notes:This setting is attributed in W. J. White’s collection The Sacred Herald to ‘T. Clark’. The same attribution is usedfor four other works in the same book, including ‘Lees Court’ on p25, a setting of James Merrick’s metrical versionof Psalm 41, ‘Blest who with generous pity glows’, which was also published in Thomas Clark’s own book A NinthSet of Psalm Tunes, London: [c1830].The order of staves in the original is Tenor - Alto - Soprano - Bass, with the alto and tenor parts given in the trebleclef an octave above sounding pitch. The Soprano and Bass staves are bracketed together and a keyboardaccompaniment is indicated between these parts with small notes: this keyboard accompaniment (which largelydoubles the inner vocal parts) has been omitted from this edition.Only the first verse of the text is given in the source: subsequent verses have here been added editorially."
