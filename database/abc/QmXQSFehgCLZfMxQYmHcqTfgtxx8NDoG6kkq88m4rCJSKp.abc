"^Notes:This setting appears in no. 28 of Thomas Clark’s The Congregational Harmonist, which was advertised on p128 of No. 48, Vol. 4, of The Musical World, on 10 February 1837.  The setting is attributed ‘T. Clark’ in The Congregational Harmonist, where it is marked with acrossed circle, a symbol used in that book to indicate ‘originals’ (i.e. tunes not previously published).The order of parts in the source is Alto - Tenor - Air - Bass, with the alto and tenor parts given in the treble clef an octave above soundingpitch. The passage given here as the alto part from bar 4 beat 4 to bar 6 beat 3 inclusive is printed in the source at the same notated pitchas given here, on the tenor stave, marked ‘2nd. Treble’. In addition, this part is doubled in small notes printed on the soprano (Air) stave,a third below the soprano part: these have been omitted in this edition. The bass instrumental part from bar 4 beat 4 to bar 6 beat 3inclusive is printed on the bass stave in the source using small notes, with full sized rests in the same bars indicating that the bass voicesare silent. Only the first verse of the text is given in the source: two further verses have here been added editorially." D,6!f! G,,2 | %6
