w: 2~Our harps, that when with joy we sung, were wont their tune- ful parts to * bear,|

w: cried out, "Her state- * ly walls de- face, and with the ground quite le- vel lay."|
w: Blessed is the man * who shall to thee the wrongs thou lay'st on us re- pay.|
w: Shall snatch thy in- * fants from the breast, and dash their heads a- gainst the stones.|
