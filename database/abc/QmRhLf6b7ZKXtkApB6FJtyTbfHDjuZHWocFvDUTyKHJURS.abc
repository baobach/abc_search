"^1. Now  in   a  song  of  grateful  praise,    To   my  dear Lord  my  voice  I'll  raise;   With     all   the   saints   I'll   join   to    tell,      That  Je – sus  has done all things well.   With     all things well.\n2. All worlds his glorious power confess,   His  wis – dom  all  his  works  ex–press;   But     O!   his  love  what tongue can tell,       My   Je – sus  has done all things well.    But      all things well.\n3. How  sovereign,  merciful  and  free,    Has  been  his  love  to  sin – ful    me!      He plucked me from  the   jaws    of   hell,       My   Je – sus  has done all things well.     He     all things well." B4 d2 d2 | %1

"^4.   I  spurned  his  grace, I broke his laws,  And  then  he  un–der–took  my  cause;   To   save  me  though  I    did    re  –  bel,       My   Je – sus  has  done all things well.  To       all things well.\n5.  And since my soul hath known his love,  What blessings hath he made me prove!  Mer – cy  which  doth  all  praise  ex–cel,       My   Je – sus  has done  all things well.  Mer-  all things well.\n6. When – e'er   my  Sa–vior or  my  God,   Hath  on  me  laid  his  gen – tle  rod;       I    know    in    all    that    has   be – fell,      That  Je – sus  has done  all things well.  That  all things well." B4 G2 B2 | %1

"^7. Though  many  a  flaming  fiery  dart,   At – tempt  their  le – vel  at  my  heart;   With    this      I     all   my   rage  re  – pel;     My   Je – sus  has  done  all things well.  With   all things well.\n  8. Sometimes the Lord his face doth hide, To  make  me  pray,  and  kill  my pride;    Yet     on   my   heart   it    still  doth  dwell,   That  Je – sus  has  done  all things well.   Yet    all things well.\n  9. Soon  I  shall  pass  this  vale  of death,  And  in  his  arms  re – sign  my breath:    Yet    then  my  hap – py   soul  shall   tell,     How Je – sus  has  done  all things well.   Yet    all things well." G4 B2 B2 | %1
