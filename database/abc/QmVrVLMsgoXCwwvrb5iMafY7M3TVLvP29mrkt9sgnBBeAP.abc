"_1. Come, all ye  people     of  my  nation,   Come listen  a while and  I'll  re – late    The wonders  of  my  sad  con–di–tion,   And  how   I        traveled from that state.\n2.  I   was  born  blind,  to  sin in–cli–ned, .As   all   of  the   race  of  A–dam  are,    Full  sixteen  years  I  was  de–ligh–ted     In    ci  –  vil       mirth, and void of fear." E4 | %1

"_3. Once unthoughtful, I   went to meeting,  And heard a woman re – la–ting there   The  travail    of   her  sad  con–di – tion,  And  how   she  came the Lord to fear.\n4.  I    saw,  while she was thus re – la–ting,  The ter–ri – ble  state that  I was  in,       I     saw  my soul was un – con–ver–ted,   And  al  – ways  had  been dead in sin." E4 | %1

"_5.  I     then  began   to  think  of  praying,  To   think  of  trying   to  seek the Lord;  But still my soul was much dis–tres–sed,    I     felt      not      yet  his healing  word.\n6.  I     then  began   to  seek con–ver–sion, And cried to  Je –sus  my  soul  to  save,   I     left  my way  of  light  de – vo –tion,   His  pro  – mised  mercy  I   did    crave." E4 | %1

"_7. My  sins  began, like pointed mountains, To stand up  against  me  every  day,     Their  number  I  was  oft  re–coun – ting,  But  all    in  vain  my  grief   t'a  –  lay.\n8. One  night, while thinking of the Savior, And what he has done for sinful man,   I thought my soul was out of  fa   –   vor,   Oh, how his mer – cy  I longed to gain." E,4 | %1
