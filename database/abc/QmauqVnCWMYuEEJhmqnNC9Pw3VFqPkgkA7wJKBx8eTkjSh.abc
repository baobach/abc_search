T:        Practical instructions about enharmonic modulation through the chords of the augmented sixth from editors of "Practical Manual of Harmony" Maksimilian Steinberg and Jāzeps Vītols: The first technique: to modulate from key X to key Y, you need to find a dominant seventh chord that is half a tone higher than the dominant seventh chord of key Y. Staying in the key of X, you need to come to this found chord in the shortest possible way (perhaps using ordinary modulation or altered chords). This chord is then equated to the appropriate chord of the augmented sixth in the key of Y and resolved in the standard way. 
T:        The second technique: to modulate from key X to key Y, you need to find a dominant four-two chord the bass of which is a semitone lower than the fifth degree of the scale in the Y key. Other actions are similar to the first technique.
