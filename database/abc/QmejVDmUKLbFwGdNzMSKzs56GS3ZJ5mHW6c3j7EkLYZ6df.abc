T:Remark by Bernard Greenberg: We will use the expression “Polytonic” progressions in the following sections, for what Rimsky-Korsakov calls "ложные последовательности”, elliptical (in the original sense of “ellipsis”, i.e., a deliberate omission) progressions, following the 1910 French edition. The English edition calls them “false progressions”, a terminology not commonly used, and falsely implying that the are erroneous (yet, he gives guidelines for them). The extremely common “false cadence” he gives is called a “deceptive cadence” in English, but “deceptive” is not a fair characterization of all these “abrupt modulations”. Hence, we will go with the polytonique of the French edition, noting how they join two tonalities (-BSG). 
T:Next, the text of Rimsky-Korsakov: 1) Any connection of two chords that belong to different keys is called a polytonic progression. 2)To use the polytonic progression, you need smooth voice leading and, if possible, leave the common tones motionless. 3)The more common tones in a polytonic progression, the softer it sounds. 4) The most common are deceptive cadences and polytonic progression of seventh chords.
