Clark’ in The Congregational Harmonist, where it is marked with a crossed circle, a symbol used in that book toindicate ‘originals’ (i.e. tunes not previously published). The order of parts in the source is Alto - Tenor - Air - Bass, with Alto and Tenor in thetreble clef an octave above sounding pitch. The first two notes of the Tenor part, in bar 1, are also given in the source as a cue in the Bass part:these have been omitted from this edition. Only the first verse of text is given in the source: three more verses have been added editorially." C2 C,2 G,3 C | %5
