"^Original order of staves is Counter - Tenor - Treble - Bass: the counter part is notated in the source in the treble clef,an octave above sounding pitch.The vocal bass part is figured in the source: this figuring has been omitted from the present edition to facilitate theunderlaying of the text. The first verse only of the text is given in the source: subsequent verses have been addededitorially, on the basis of the title 'Psalm 23d. 1 2 3 & 6 Verses' in the source. Notes printed as small grace notesin the source have been written out in full in the present edition." (E,>F, G,)E, B,2 z G, | %10
