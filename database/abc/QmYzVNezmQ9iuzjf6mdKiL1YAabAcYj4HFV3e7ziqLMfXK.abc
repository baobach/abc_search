"^1. Draw nigh, and take the body of the Lord,\n    And drink the holy blood for you outpoured.\n\n2. Saved by that body, hallowed by that blood,\n    Whereby refreshed, we render thanks to God.\n\n3. Salvation's giver, Christ the only Son,\n    By that his cross and blood the victory won.\n\n4. Offered was He for greatest and for least:\n    Himself the Victim, and Himself the Priest.\n\n5. Victims were offered by the law of old,\n    That, in a type, celestial mysteries told."

Approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,\n     And take the safeguard of salvation here.\n\n 8. He that, in this world, rules His saints and shields,\n     To all believers life eternal yields:\n\n 9. With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,\n     Gives living waters to the thirsty soul.\n\n10. Alpha and Omega, to whom shall bow\n      All nations at the doom, is with us now.\n" A,2 | %6
