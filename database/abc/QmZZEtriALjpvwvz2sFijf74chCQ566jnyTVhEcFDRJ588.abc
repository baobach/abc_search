"^5.  Love sits on his eye-lids and scatters delight\nThrough all the bright mansions on high;\nTheir faces the cherubim veil in his sight,\nAnd tremble with fullness of joy.\nHe looks, and ten thousand of angels rejoice,\nAnd myriads wait for his word;\nHe speaks--and eternity, filled with his voice,\nRe-echoes the praise of the her voice.\n6.  His vestments of righteousness who shall describe!\nIts purity words would defile;\nThe heavens from his presence fresh beauties imbibe,\nAnd earth is made rich by his smile.\nSuch is my beloved in excellence bright,\nWhen pleased he looks down from above;\nLike the morn, when he breathes from the chamber of light,\nAnd comforts his people with love.\n7.  But when armed with vengeance, in terror he comes,\nThe nations' rebellions to tame,\nThe reins of omnipotent power he assumes,\nAnd rides in a chariot of flame." B,,4 | %16

"^A two edged sword from his mouth issues forth,\nBright quivers of fire are his eyes;\nHe speaks, the black tempests are seen in the north,\nAnd storms from their caverns arise.\n8.  The thousand destructions, that wait for his word,\nAnd ride on the wings of his breath,\nFly swift as the winds at the nod of their Lord,\nAnd deal out his arrows of death,\nHis cloud-bursting thunders, their voices resound\nThrough all the vast regions on high;\nTill from the deep center loud echoes rebound,\nAnd meet the quick flames in the sky.\n9.  The portals of heaven at his bidding obey,\nAnd expand ere his banners appear;\nEarth trembles beneath, till her mountains give way,\nAnd hell shakes her fetters with fear.\nWhen he treads on the clouds as the dust of his feet,\nAnd grasps the storm in his hand;\nWhat eye the fierce glance of his anger shall meet,\nOr who in his presence shall stand?"
