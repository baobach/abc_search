T:35.  Dixie
T:This, is the most rollicking of our National Songs, was written and composed for a negro minstrel show, by Daniel Decatur Emmett.  Only two of the many verses are here given.  Another cersion, "The U.S.A. Forever," written by Angus S. Hibbard, is included.  The song, as originally, was instantaneously successful and became a Confederate war-song.  Since then it has become a favorite throughout this country and as a band composition is played all over the world.
