"^1. O come, let us lift up our voice,    And sing unto the Lord;  In him our rock of health rejoice  Let   us      with  one     ac   –    cord.\n2. Yea, let us come before his face  To give him thanks and praise:  In singing psalms unto his grace  Let us  be       glad    al    –   ways." F4 c2 f2 A2 c2 B2 A2 G4 | %1

For why? the Lord he is no doubt  A great and mighty God, A King above all gods throughout, In  all    the  world      a   –  broad.\n4. The  secrets  of  the  earth  so  deep, And corners of the land, The tops of hills that are most steep, He holds them in   his     hand.""^5. Come, let us bow and praise the Lord, Before him let us fall, And kneel to him with one accord, For  he  hath  made us        all.\n6. For  why?  he is the Lord our God, For us he doth provide;  We  are his flock, he doth us feed, His  sheep, and  he       our     guide.""^7. The sea and waters all are his, For he the same hath wrought: The earth and all that therein is  His  hand  hath  made of     nought.\n8. Today if ye his voice will hear, Then harden not your heart,  As  ye with grudging many a year  Provoked him in    de  –  sert." F,4 G,2 A,2 A,2 A,2 G,2 F,2 E,4 | %1
