"^1. Thou  man  of  grief, remember me,     Who   never  canst  thyself  for–get    Thy  last  mysterious a–go–ny,  Thy fainting pangs, and bloody sweat,\n2. When wrestling in the strength of prayer  Thy spirit sunk beneath its load, Thy feeble flesh abhorred to bear  The  wrath  of  an  Al–migh–ty God." B4 | %1

"^3.  A  taste  of  thy  tor-men-ting  fears   If now thou dost to me impart, Give the full virtue of thy tears, The cries which pierced thy Father’s heart;\n4. U–nite  my sorrows  to thine own,  And let me to my God complain, Who melted by thy Spirit’s groan,   Can  save  me  from  that  endless  pain." E4 | %1

I  tremble, lest the wrath divine  Which bruises now my wretched soul,  Should bruise this wretched soul of mine,  Long  as  e –ter –nal  ages  roll." (G3 F) | %1

"^__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n    The version shown above is of William Hauser's \nKedron \nfrom 1878, including Charles Wesley's original words from 1762.\n    The tune was first published by Amos Pilsbury for four parts in his \nUnited States Sacred Harmony\n, 1799, without attribution. Arramged by Elkanah Dare for three parts \nin 1813; then by Ananias Davisson for four parts in 1816 and again in 1817, the latter as \nGarland\n (with different words by Isaac Watts, \"How pleasant, how divinely fair\"). \nIt was arranged again by Alexander Johnson for four parts in 1818; this arrangement became the basis for the three-part versions in \nSouthern Harmony\n, 1835 (p. 3) \nand \nThe Sacred Harp\n, 1844 (p. 48). The complex history of this tune is discussed at length by David Music (1995); he concludes that Pilsbury arranged a folk tune obtained\norally or from an unattributed manuscript.\n    The words Pilsbury (1799) used are the first stanza of Hymn 686 by Charles Wesley, 1762, altered; they were further altered by William Walker (1835), so that the line\nreads \n          Thou man of grief, remember me;\n          Thou never canst thyself forget\n          Thy last expiring agony,\n          Thy fainting pangs, and bloody sweat. \n    A folk hymn, derived from one or several folk songs (Jackson 1953b, No. 57).""^7. To  thee  my  last  dis–tress  I   bring:  The heightened fear of death I find;  The tyrant brandishing his sting  Ap –pears,  and  hell  is  close  behind!\n8. I  de – pre – cate  that  death  alone,    That endless banishment from thee:  O save, and give me to thy Son, Who trembled, wept, and bled for me." E,4 | %1
