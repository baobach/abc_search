"^Original order of staves is Counter - Tenor - Treble - Bass: the counter part is notated in the source in the treble clef, anoctave above sounding pitch. The vocal bass part is figured in the original: this figuring has been omitted from the presentedition. Only the first verse only of the text is given in the original: subsequent verses have been added editorially, on thebasis of the title 'Psalm 1st Verses 1 2 3 & last' in the original. The treble D and tenor Bb quavers on the first quarter of beat2 of bars 2 and 6 are printed in the source as small quaver grace notes, and have been editorially written out in full. Thelast note in the tenor part is preceded in the source by a small crotchet F grace note (the same as the lower of the other twonotes in this bar): this has been omitted from the present edition as questionable in interpretation and possibly erroneous."
