"^Notes:Only fragments of the first verse of the text (‘O Lord &c.’ and ‘thou Still &c.’) are given in the source: theremainder of this verse, and three selected subsequent verses, have here been added editorially.The top three parts are given in the treble clef, with the alto and tenor parts an octave above sounding pitch.The soprano part is identifiable as the topmost stave because of the use of a distinctive 'G' clef, commentedon by Bennett in a preface, ‘The common Theory of Music made easy, in a DIALOGUE between MASTERand SCHOLAR’, which forms pages [I] - IV of A New Set of Psalm Tunes and Anthems:‘[A]s the G Cliff is by far the easiest for young Beginners, I have set all the three upper Parts in that Cliff, onlyfor Distinction I have set Gs to the Treble, and the modern G Cliff Signature to the two inner Parts, as theyare sung an Octave below.’" B,2 B,A, G,2 C,2 | %10
