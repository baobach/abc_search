w: My heart and tongue were twinnes, at once con- ceiv- ed, Th'el- dest was my * heart, borne dumbe by de- sti- nie, The last my tongue, of all sweet, sweete thoughts be- reaved: Yet strung and tunde, and tunde to play, * * * * to play hearts har- * * mo- nie. *|
w: Both knit in one, and yet a sun- der placed, * what heart would speake * the tongue doth full dis- co- ver What tongue doth speake is of the heart, heart em- braced, and both are one, are one to make, * * * * to make a new * * found Lov- er.|
w: New found, and one- ly found in Gods and Kings, * whose wordes are deedes, * but wordes, nor deedes re- gar- ded. Chaste thoughts doe mount and flye with swift- * est wings, My love with paine, with paine, * * * * with paine my paine * * with losse re- ward- ed.|
