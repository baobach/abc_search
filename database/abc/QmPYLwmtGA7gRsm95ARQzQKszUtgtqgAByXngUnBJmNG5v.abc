"^1. Ah!  whither  shall    I     go,       Burdened and  sick and faint?     To whom should  I  my  trou–ble   show,    Or pour out  my com–plaint?\n2. The  Sa –vior bids me come;     Ah!  Why  do     I       de – lay?       He  calls   the    wea –ry   sin – ner home,    And  yet  from  him  I     stay." c4 | %1

"^______________________________________________\nThis tune was re-harmonized  by Lucius Chapin in 1812, in\n   four parts, re-titled \nNinety-Third Psalm\n. In the re-harmonized form \n   it appeared in \nSouthern Harmony\n, 1835, page 7 (three parts); \n   and in \nThe Sacred Harp\n, page 31, from 1844 (three parts) to \n   the present. Some time before 1911 the tune in \nThe Sacred Harp \n \n   acquired a different Alto part than Chapin's.""^5. Je–sus,  the  hindrance  show,  Which I  have  feared  to  see,       Yet   let   me   now  con–sent  to     know   What  keeps  me  out  of  thee.\n6. Sear–cher  of  hearts, in mine    Thy  try–ing  power display,       In – to   its    dar–kest  cor–ners  shine,     And   take   the  veil   a – way.\n7.  I  now  be – lieve,    in    thee      Com–pas–sion reigns alone;       Ac–cor–ding   to   my  faith  to     me            O     let    it,    Lord,  be  done.\n8. In  me    is       all       the    bar    Which thou would  fain remove;   Re–move   it,  and    I   shall   de – clare      That  God  is   on – ly     love." C,4 | %1
