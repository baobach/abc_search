 A,4"_4.{""_The King's highway of holiness,    And we'll all shout  together in that morning;\nI'll go, for all his paths are peace,   And we'll all shout together in that  morning.""_5. This is the way I long have sought,\nAnd we'll all shout together in that morning;\nAnd mourned because I found it not;\nAnd we'll all shout together in that morning.\n\n6. My grief a burden long has been.\nAnd we'll all shout together in that morning;\nBecause I was not saved from sin,\nAnd we'll all shout together in that morning.""_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEdited by B. C. Johnston, 2018. Whole song converted from 4:4 time to 2:4 time, to eliminate long rests in the original.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis is apparently the first arrangement of this tune, based on a camp meeting folk hymn from the last eighteenth or early nineteenth century.  Other arrangements from the same\n   source are by John G. McCurry (\nBurges\n, from \nThe Social Harp\n, 1855) and Henry S. Reese (\nSweet Morning\n, from \nThe Sacred Harp\n, p. 421, 1860 to the present). \nSweet Morning\n in \n   The Sacred Harp is based on an English folk tune (Jackson 1953, No. 168)." | %1
