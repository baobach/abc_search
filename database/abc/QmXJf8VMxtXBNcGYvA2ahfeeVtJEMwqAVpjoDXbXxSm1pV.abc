"^The source gives the parts in the order Tenor - Alto - Treble - Bass (labelled as such in the first piece in the book).The treble and bass parts are bracketed together, with small notes between them to fill in the harmony of a keyboardpart doubling the voices. This accompaniment has been omitted from the present edition. Only the  first verse of thetext is underlaid in the source. Three subsequent verses have been added editorially: it is suggested that thecrotchet on beat 3 of bar 5 be extended to a dotted crotchet in the last verse, to avoid splitting the syllables of theword ‘amazing’."
