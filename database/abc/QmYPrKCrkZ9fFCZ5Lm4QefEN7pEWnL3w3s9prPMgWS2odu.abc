"^1582. The following is Calderwood's account of the return of Durie to Edinburgh after a temporary banishment:  \"John Durie cometh to Leith \nat night the 3d of September.  Upon Tuesday the 4th of September, as he is coming to Edinburgh, there met him at the Gallowgreen 200, but \nere he came to the Netherbow their number increased to 400; but they were no sooner entered but they encreased to 600 or 700, and within \nshort space the whole street was replenished even to Saint Geiles Kirk: the number was esteemed to 2000. At the Netherbow they took up the \n124 Psalme, \"Now Israel may say,\" &c., and sung in such a pleasant tune in four parts, known to the most part of the people, that coming up the \nstreet all bareheaded till they entered in the Kirk, with such a great sound and majestic that it moved both themselves and all the huge multitude \nof the beholders, looking out at the shots and over stairs, with admiration and astonishment: the Duke himself beheld, and reave his beard for \nanger: he was more affrayed of this sight than anie thing that ever he had seene before in Scotland. When they came to the kirk, Mr James Lowsone \nmade a short exhortation in the Reader's place, to move the multitude to thankfulnes. Thereafter a psalm being sung, they departed with great joy.\" \n(Livingston 1864, p. 17; Livingston goes on to say that the above were the words and music that they  sang)" C,4 G,2 A,2 G,4 E,4 D,2 D,2 (E,2 C,2) G,4 C,16 |] %5
