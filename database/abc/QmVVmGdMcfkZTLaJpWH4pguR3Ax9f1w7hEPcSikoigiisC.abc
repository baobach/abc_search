"^Original order of staves is Counter - Tenor - Treble - Bass, with the counter part printed in the treble clef an octave abovesounding pitch. Figuring of the vocal bass part in the source has been omitted from the present edition. Notes printed inthe source as small grace notes have been editorially written out in full.The source gives Ps. 135 NV, ‘O praise the Lord with one consent’, as the text for this tune, but has a note below the music:‘N. B. The above Psalm may be sung as a Christmas Hymn to the words, Shepherds rejoice lift up your eyes And send yourfears away. &c:’. Four verses of that text have here been underlaid editorially."
