w: Who is she as-|cends so high,|Next the heav'n- ly|King,|Round a- bout whom|an- gels fly|And her praise- es *|sing?|
w: Who is she a-|dorned with light,|Makes the sun her|robe,|At whose feet the|queen of night|Lays her chang- ing *|globe?|
w: Heav'n she was, which|held that fire,|Whence the world took|light,|And to heav'n doth|now as- pire|Flames with flames to u-|night.|
w: She that did so|clear- ly shine|When our day be-|gun,|See how bright her|beams de- cline:|Now she sits with the|Sun.|
