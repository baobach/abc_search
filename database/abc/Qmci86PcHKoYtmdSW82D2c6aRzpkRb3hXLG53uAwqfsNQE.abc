"_1. Did ever you see the like before? I know the Lord's laid His hands on me; \n    King Jesus preaching to the poor! I know the Lord's laid His hands on me.\n\n2. O wasn't that a happy day, I know the Lord's laid His hands on me; \n    When Jesus washed my sins away? I know the Lord's laid His hands on me.\n\n3. -- Some seek the Lord and don't seek Him right, I know the Lord's laid His hands on me; \n    They fool all day and pray at night, I know the Lord's laid His hands on me.\n\n4. -- My Lord's done just what He said, I know the Lord's laid His hands on me;\n    He's healed the sick and raise the dead, I know the Lord's laid His hands on me."
