T:5. And when, dear Spirit! I kneel down - Morning and night to prayer Something there is within my heart - Which tells me thou are there. 6. Yes! when I pray, thou prayest too - Thy prayer is all for me; But when I sleep, thou sleepest not, - But watchest patiently. 7. But most of all I feel thee near, - When, from the good priest's feet, I go absolved, in fearless love, - Fresh toils and cares to meet. 8. Ah me! how lovely they must be -  Whom God has glorified: Yet one of them, O sweetest thought! - Is ever at my side. 9. And thou in life's last hour wilt bring - A fresh supply of grace, And afterwards wilt let me kiss - Thy beautiful bright face. 10. Then for thy sake, dear Angel! now - More humble will I be: But I am weak, and when I fall, - Oh, weary not for me: 11. Oh, weary not, but love me still, - For Mary's sake, thy Queen: She never tired of me, though I - Her worst of sons have been. 12. She will reward thee with a smile; Thou know'st what it is worth! For Mary's smiles each day convert - The hardest hearts on earth. 13. Then love me, love me, Angel dear! - And I will love thee more; And help me when my soul is cast - Upon the eternal shore.
