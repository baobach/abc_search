"^_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nA folk hymn, derived from an 18th-century folk song tune, \nJust as the Tide Was A-Flowing\n (Jackson 1953b, No. 119; Steel and Hulan 2010).   The tune was re-harmonized in four parts in \nSupplement to the \n       Kentucky Harmony\n, 1820, renamed \nClamanda \nand attributed to \"Chapin\". This re-harmonization was the basis for \nClamanda\n, page 42 in \nThe Sacred Harp\n, 1844 to the present\n, \nfrom 1844-1911 reduced to  \n    three parts. In 1911 it acquired an Alto part unrelated to the Counter part written by Chapin; Warren Steel (web addenda to \nThe Makers\n) says \"Alto after W. M. Cooper, 1902.\"\nEdited by B. C. Johnston, 2017:  Measure 13, Tenor: first note changed from G to G#; Counter part written." E2 E,2 A,4 | %15
