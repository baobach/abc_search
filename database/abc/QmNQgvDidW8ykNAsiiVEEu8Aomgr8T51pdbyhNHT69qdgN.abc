"^2. Now death starts to die, grace gains       the     vic    –   tory,  And pride falls a prey to the ground;     We lift up our heads, as we rise from the dead,  And  the  glo–ry  of  God  shines  around.""^1. The  great  God  of  love  has   shown      us      the         way,  And  taught us the  impartial  song:      The  Spirit  is  come,  and  the  work  is  begun,  And  we  all  are  u  – ni   –ted   in   love."

"^3. Sal  –  va  –  tion, we see,  for   all            is        most    free;  The  members  of Christ are all one: We'll march uniform, with courage face the storm, In  the  bat – tle  our Sa–vior  has  won.""^4. U  –  ni  –  ted   in    one,  the   race        we      will         run, Press forward in faith, without fear;    Such  glories  pur–sue  as the world never knew,  Never  will,  till  the  Gos–pel  they hear.""^5. Re – pro – ver   of    sin     has   shown     us        the       way,  The  Com–for–ter  leads  us  a – long;   The book is un-sealed, The Li –on takes the field,  And he learns us the im –par –tial  song."

"^8. We   will    tune our songs   in      an –  thems    of       praise,  And  join  with  the  seraphs  above;   Free grace we will sound through eternity's round, When  our  union shall heighten in love.""^9.
