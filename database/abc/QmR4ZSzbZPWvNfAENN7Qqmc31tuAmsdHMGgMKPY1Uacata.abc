I    cry   till  all    my  voice  be   gone,    In   tears  I   waste  the   day:   My God,  be–hold  my  long–ing   eyes,  And   shor –  ten       thy             de – lay.\n3. They hate my soul  with–out  a   cause,   And  still their number grows   More than the hairs  a–round my head,  And  migh –   ty       are              my  foes.""^Jesus   speaks," B4 | %1
