"^1. Sure  there's  a  right–eous  God, Nor is  re–li–gion vain; Though men of  vice  may boast a – loud,        And  men    of   grace  com–plain.""^2. I        saw  the    wick –  ed   rise,  And felt  my heart  repine, While haughty fools with scornful  eyes      In    robes  of       ho – nor  shine." B4 | %1

"^3. Pampered with wan –  ton ease, Their flesh looks full and fair;  Their wealth  rolls  in like flowing  seas, And grows with–out  their care.""^4. Free from  the plagues and pains That  pi–ous souls en–dure;  Through all their life  oppression reigns, And racks   the  hum–ble    poor." E4 | %1

"^5. Their impious tongues blaspheme  The  everlasting   God;  Their malice  blasts  the good man's name,  And  spreads their lies   a –broad.""^6. But  I     with    flo –  wing  tears   Indulged my doubts to rise;  \"Is  there  a  God  that  sees  or  hears    The   things    be –  low  the skies?\"" E4 | %1

"^9. On  what a  slip – pery steep  The thoughtless wretches go; And  O  that  dread – ful    fie–ry     deep     That  waits   their  fall      be  –  low!""^8. Thy word with light and power  Did my mis–take amend;    I   viewed the  sin–ners'  life be – fore,       But  here        I      learnt  their  end.""^10. Lord,  at  thy   feet   I   bow,  My thoughts no more repine;    I    call   my   God       my   portion  now,     And   all        my  powers  are  thine.""^7.
