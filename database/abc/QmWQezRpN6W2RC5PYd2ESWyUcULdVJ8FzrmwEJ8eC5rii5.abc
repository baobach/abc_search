w: When * the poore, poore Cri- ple by the * poole * * did lye, Full ma- ny, ma- ny yeeres, full ma- ny, ma- ny yeeres in mi- se- ry and paine, in mi- ser- ry and paine, No soon- er hee on Christ had set his eye, No soon- er hee on Christ had * set his eye, his eye, But hee was well, hee was well, and com- fort, com- fort came a- * gaine, com- fort came a- * gaine, No Da- * vid, no Job, nor Cri- ple, nor Cri- ple, Cri- ple in more griefe, in more * * griefe, Christ give mee pa- tience, give me pa- tience, pa- * tience, and my hopes re- * * liefe.|
