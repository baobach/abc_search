"^Notes:Thomas Clark’s The Congregational Harmonist, or Clerk’s Companion was published in 32 numbered parts (eachconsisting of 18 pages), grouped into four books (eight parts per book). The pages are consecutively paginatedthroughout the work as a whole. This setting appears in no. 28, which was advertised on p128 of No. 48, Vol. 4,of The Musical World, on 10 February 1837. This setting is attributed ‘T. Clark’ in The Congregational Harmonist, where it is marked with a crossed circle, asymbol used in that book to indicate ‘originals’ (i.e. tunes not previously published).The order of parts in the source is Alto - Tenor - Air - Bass, with the Alto and Tenor parts given in the treble clef anoctave above sounding pitch.Only the first verse of the text is given in the source: subsequent verses have here been added editorially.In addition to the figured bass in the source, which is reproduced here, the notes sung by the alto part in bars 8-9are shown in the source in small notes on the Air staff, to encourage their use in keyboard accompaniment of thepiece: these have been omitted from the present edition.""^64""^53" C,4"^6""^-5" B,,4 | %13
