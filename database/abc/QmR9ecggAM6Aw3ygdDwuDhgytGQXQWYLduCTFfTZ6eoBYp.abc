"^2. Faithful and honest to friend and foe,Willing to die in humanity's cause;Thus we defy all tyrannical pow'r, While we contend for our union and laws!Hail, three times hail to our country and flag!Thus we defy all tyrannical pow'r,While we contend for our union and laws!Hail, three times hail to our country and flag!""^6. Angels of Bethlehem, answer the strain! Hark! a new birth-song is filling the sky!Loud as the storm-wind that tumbles the main.Bid the full breath of the organ reply,Loud let the tempest of voices reply;Rolls its long surge like the earth-shaking main!Swell the vast song till it mounts to the sky!Angel of Bethlehem, echo the strain!""^4. Angel of Peace,  thou hast wandered too long;Spread thy white wings to the sunshine of love!Come while our voices are blended in song. Fly to our ark like the storm-beaten dove.Fly to our ark on the wings of the dove,Speed o'er the far-sounding billows of song,Crowned with the olive-leaf garland of love;Angel of Peace, thou ast waited too long!"

Hail, three times to our country and flag!""^5. Brothers we meet on this altar of thine,Mingling the gifts we have gathered for thee;Sweet with the odors of myrtle and pine,Breeze of the prairie and breath of the sea,Meadow and mountain and forest and sea;Sweet is the fragrance of myrtle and pine,Sweeter the incense we offer to thee,Brothers once more round this altar of thine!"
