"^1. O Lord, give ear to my just cause,             Attend unto my cry,           And hear the prayer I offer up      To Thee unfeignedly; \n     2. And let the judgment of my cause       Proceed always from Thee,  And let thine eyes behold and clear Truth and simplicity." G4 A2 c2 B2 d2 d2 ^c2 d4 | %1

"^3. Thou hast well tried me in the night, And yet could  nothing find, That I have spoken with my tongue, That was not in my mind. \n       4. As for the works of wicked men,        And paths perverse and ill,      For love of Thy most holy name  I have refrained still.""^5. Then in Thy paths that be most pure,  Lord, guide me, and preserve, That from the way wherein I walk My steps may never swerve. \n6. For  I  do  call  to Thee, O Lord,  Surely Thou wilt me aid;  Then hear my prayer, and weigh right well  The words that I have said.""^7. O  Thou,  the  Savior  of  all  them  That put their trust in Thee,  Declare Thy strength on them that spurn  Against Thy majesty. \n8. O keep me as Thou wouldest keep     The apple of Thine eye,            And under cover of Thy wings         Defend me secretly.""^_____________________________________________\nEdited by B. C.
