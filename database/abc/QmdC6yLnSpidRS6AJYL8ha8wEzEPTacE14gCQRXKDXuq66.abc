"^5. Where are those we counted leaders,\nFilled with zeal, and love, and truth?\nOld professors, tall as cedars,\nBright examples to our youth!\n6. Some, in whom we once delighted,\nWe shall meet no more below;\nSome, alas! we fear are blighted,\nScarce a single leaf they show.\n7. Younger plants – the sight how pleasant,\nCovered thick with blossoms stood;\nBut they cause us grief at present,\nFrosts have nipped them in the bud!""^8. Dearest Savior, hasten hither,\nThou canst make them bloom again;\nO, permit them not to wither,\nLet not all our hopes be vain!\n9. Let our mutual love be fervent,\nMake us prevalent in prayers;\nLet each one esteemed thy servant,\nShun the world’s bewitching snares:\n10. Break the tempter’s fatal power,\nTurn the stony heart to flesh;\nAnd begin, from this good hour,\nTo revive thy work afresh." c4 |] %24
