"^This is a popular dance, which is used at danish medieval Festivals (but is highly likely to be used in other countries as well)\nIt starts when everybody has a partner, and make a big circle, male and female dancer holding hands loosely.\nEveryone looks counter-clock wise with the male dancer closest to center.\nThere is no upper limit of how many participants can participate, though a larger number makes a more difficult dance.\n\nThe dance is compromised of 2 parts, each being repeated ones (as can be seen in the music notes)\nEvery step happens at the 1 and 3 beat. \n\n1. part is 3 steps ahead, turn around, 3 steps back, stop. So 1 , 2 , 3, Turn , 1 , 2 , 3 , Stop. Repeat ones\n\n2. part goes like this: Jump in, 2, jump out, 4, switch, place, 3, 4 repeat but switch partner in the end instead!\nthe first time one switches place is by the male taking the right hand of the female with his left hand, \nand then she goes in front of him so she now stands in the innermost circle to the left of the male.\nThe next time one switches partner is by making the female go under the males arm pit \nwhile the male steps forward to greet his new dancing partner with his right hand. \nIt is important that the male stands in the inner circle after this, so the dance can start again.\n\nThen repeat it all while the music go faster and faster, until either the dancers or the musicians cant follow any longer.\n\nIf there are any ideas of improvement to my description then i would love to \nimplement them to make a more easy to understand dancing tutorial."
