"^1. Twas on that dark, that doleful night  When powers of earth and hell arose  Against the Son  of God's  de–light,  And  friends  betrayed  him  to  his  foes:\n2. Before the mournful scene began,  He took the bread, and blessed, and brake: What love through all his actions ran! What wondrous words of grace he spake!" A4 | %1

"^3. \"This   is   my  bo – dy,  broke for sin;  Receive and eat the living food:\"       Then took the cup, and blessed the wine;  \"Tis the new cove–nant  in my  blood.\"\n4.  For us his flesh with nails was torn,  He bore the scourge, he felt the thorn; And  jus–tice poured up–on his head       Its hea–vy  ven–geance in our stead.\n5.  For us  his  vi – tal  blood  was spilt, To buy the par–don  of  our guilt,        When, for black crimes of biggest  size,      He  gave  his  soul  a   sac – ri – fice." E4 | %1
